        "Local Version Control": "Local version control is a system that allows developers to store their code changes in a local repository. This system allows developers to track and store changes to any type of file, including source code, configuration files, and text documents. It also enables multiple developers to work on the same project and merge their changes with ease.",
        "Centralized Version Control": "Centralized version control is a system that allows developers to store their code in a centralized place. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same project and merge their changes with ease. It also enables developers to track changes to any type of file, including source code, configuration files, and text documents.",
        "Distributed Version Control": "Distributed version control is a system that allows developers to store their code in multiple locations. Each location has its own repository with its own version of the code. This system allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same project and merge their changes with ease. It also enables developers to track changes to any type of file, including source code, configuration files, and text documents.",
        "Git": "Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to store their code in multiple locations. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same project and merge their changes with ease. It also enables developers to track changes to any type of file, including source code, configuration files, and text documents.",
        "Subversion": "Subversion is a centralized version control system that allows developers to store their code in a centralized place. It enables multiple developers to collaborate on the same project and merge their changes with ease. It also enables developers to track changes to any type of file, including source code, configuration files, and text documents."
