    "sub-topics": {
        "API Architecture": "The first step towards building scalable APIs is to design an architecture that is well-structured and optimized for performance. This can include designing components such as endpoints, request and response objects, caching strategies, and authentication protocols.",
        "API Versioning": "A key element of designing a scalable API is to develop a versioning system. This will ensure that new features are introduced without breaking existing applications. A good approach is to use versioning within the URL.",
        "API Documentation": "A well-maintained API documentation is essential for developers to understand the API and how to use it. It should include information such as the endpoints, parameters, authentication, and data formats.",
        "API Performance": "API performance is critical to ensuring the success of an API. It should be tested and monitored on a regular basis. This can be done using tools such as load testing, monitoring response time, and tracking errors.",
        "API Security": "Security is crucial for any API. It should be designed to protect against malicious attacks and protect user data. This can be done using encryption, authentication, and authorization protocols."
